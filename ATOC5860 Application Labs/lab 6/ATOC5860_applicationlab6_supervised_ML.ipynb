    "## STEP 2: Data and Function Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation is a huge part of building Machine Learning model \"pipelines\". Carefully think through building & training a Machine Learning model before you run it. There are a few statistical \"gotchas\" that may result in your model being biased, inaccurate, or not suitable for the problem at hand.  Address these 6 questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1: What exactly are we trying to predict? A value, an outcome, a category?** Define your predictors and predictand. Relate these to your hypothesis or overarching question. In our case, our predictand is the likelihood of precipitation. We will build models to predict the likelihood that it's currently precipitating, given current atmospheric conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Do you have any missing data? If so, how will you handle them?** Keep in mind, decreasing the number of input observations may bias your model. Using the Christman dataset, we have no missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3: Do you have any categorical or non-numeric variables or features?** If so, you must figure out how to encode them into numbers. Luckily, in the geosciences, we rarely run into this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: How will we validate our model?** Typically, people split their existing data into training data and testing data, or perform \"cross-validation\" or a \"test-train split\". That is, we will \"hold out\" some data and call it our \"testing data\", while using the rest of the data to train our model (i.e., \"training data\"). Once our model is trained, we will evaluate its performance with the holdout testing data. Note: This could be problematic if there is limited data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5: Do your features have the same variance?** You need to consider this to ensure your model doesn't overly depend on one variable with large variance. This step is called \"feature scaling\". Features of the same size also speed up the Gradient Descent algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6: If classification is the goal, are there the same number of observations for each feature and outcome? If not, how will you rebalance?** Here, the Christman dataset has same number of observations (8784) for each feature. But, times with no precipitation are way more common than times with precipitation. To deal with this issue, we will oversample the observations associated with precip so that the two outcomes (or \"classes\") are equal. Note: It's important that feature scaling or normalization is performed before any rebalancing so that the qualitative statistics (mean, stddev, etc) remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7: Which metrics are appropriate for assessing your model?** Consider the bias-variance trade-off, and whether having false positives or false negatives is more impactful.
